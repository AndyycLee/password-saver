Created with TypeScript, React, and Firebase, an easy chrome extension for saving passwords!

This is a [Plasmo extension](https://docs.plasmo.com/) project bootstrapped with [`plasmo init`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plasmo).


## How do I run this?

You need to have the .env File setup properly, git clone the project, and setup the .env. Then you can run: npm install, npm run dev

and Open your chrome extensions tab, and load unpacked -> build/chrome-mv3-dev
